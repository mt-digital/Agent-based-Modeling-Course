    "text": "Hello, and welcome to the course website for Agent-Based Modeling, EBS 181/281, developed and taught by Dr.Â Matthew Turner, and offered for the first time Spring 2025 for Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability undergraduates and graduate students! Join the course to develop a nuanced understanding of human social behavior while learning advanced, transferable agent-based modeling computational skills using the R programming language.\n\n\nWe meet twice weekly, currently scheduled for Monday and Wednesday 11:30am-12:50pm, but subject to change, location pending. Each week will have twin themes, one social science phenomenon (e.g., political polarization) and one computational technique or skill (e.g., data science essentials for agent-based modeling). Lectures will include relevant computer and software engineering topics for designing efficient agent-based modeling programs that can be run on a supercomputing cluster. Stanford students will run their models on the Sherlock computing cluster here at Stanford."
